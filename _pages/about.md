I am currently a 6th year PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) at Harvard University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Flavio P. Calmon](https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~flavio/). My research lies at the intersection of information theory, statistical learning theory, and optimization. My ultimate research goal is to design trustworthy machine learning algorithms with rigorous performance guarantees.

Before joining Harvard University, I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2016. I was awarded the 35th Guo Moruo Scholarship which is the highest honor at USTC.
